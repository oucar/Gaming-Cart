* This project was built using Java SE 13. However, after I started to test out my program I realized that .jar file was not working on some of the local machines in my school's  windows machines. So;

GamingCart.jar uses Java SE 8
GamingCart13.jar uses Java SE 13

All the files that I uploaded to github (in bin and src) are the files of GamingCart13.jar.


### What it does

* This is a dashboard system for game stores.
